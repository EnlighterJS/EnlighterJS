EnlighterJS is OpenSource and managed on [GitHub](https://github.com/AndiDittrich/EnlighterJS) - if you like, you're welcome to contribute!
To simplify the release and quality control process, please follow these remarks:

* Your commits/pull-request should only contain changes of the `Source/`, `Resources/TestcaseData` diectories or the Examples located into the root directory - otherwise i have to merge the request manually
* **Do not change** the files located into the `Examples/` or `Build/` directory - they are automatically generated during the build-process using data from `Resources/TestcaseData`
* Related software packages like MooTools, Bootstrap, ANT-contrib, YUI-compressor are updated by the maintainer
